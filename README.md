## NumPy or Numerical Python
It is a Python library that supports large, multi-dimensional arrays & matrices and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It was created by Travis Oliphant in 2005. It is designed to be fast and efficient for performing numerical computations & mathematical functions for operations such as; <br/>
- Array manipulation<br/>
- Linear Algebra<br/>
- Fourier Transform<br/>
- Random Number Generation, and many more.<br/><br/>

### Importing NumPy in Python
To utilize NumPy in our code, we need to import it by adding the following line at the beginning of the script:
>import numpy as np
